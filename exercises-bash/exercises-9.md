# Exercises chapter 9
### 1. Create a script that will take a (recursive) copy of files in /etc so that a beginning system administrator can edit files without fear.

### 2. Write a script that takes exactly one argument, a directory name. If the number of arguments is more or less than one, print a usage message. If the argument is not a directory, print another message. For the given directory, print the five biggest files and the five files that were most recently modified.

### 3. Can you explain why it is so important to put the variables in between double quotes in the example from Section 9.4.2?

### 4. Write a script similar to the one in Section 9.5.1, but think of a way of quitting after the user has executed 3 loops.

### 5. Think of a better solution than move -b for the script from Section 9.5.3 to prevent overwriting of existing files. For instance, test whether or not a file exists. Don't do unnecessary work!

### 6. Rewrite the whichdaemon.sh script from Section 7.2.4. See book for requirements
